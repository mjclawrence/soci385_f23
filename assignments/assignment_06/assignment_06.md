## SOCI 385 - Social Statistics
## Fall 2023
## Assignment 6

\vspace{2.0em}

***This assignment is due via Canvas by 10:00 AM on Tuesday, November 28, 2023.***

Your homework this weekend is to start thinking about your final project. The final project will be a written report related to a research question that you propose.

***If you have a dataset you would like to use for this project***, you are free to do so. In that case, describe the dataset (in words, no "descriptive statistics" required), including where the data come from. Identify three variables: a continuous dependent variable, a continuous independent variable, and a categorical control variable. Note that the categorical control variable could be created from another continuous variable (like we created `hdi_cat` from `hdi` in class).

***If you do not have a dataset you would like to use for this project***, I suggest starting with the General Social Survey. Choose one continuous independent variable (preferably age or education in years) and one categorical control variable (preferably sex, race, marital status, class, or religion). Choose a continuous dependent variable from the `gssr` package or the GSS website: [**https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org**]( https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org). Note that the continuous dependent variable can be based on a numerical scale (like `eqwlth`); basically, make sure that you will be able to calculate the mean of your continuous dependent variable. Your continuous dependent variable should be included in at least one of the 2010-2021 surveys.

***For everyone***: In a paragraph, propose a research question for the relationship between your dependent variable and independent variable, and suggest a hypothesis for how that relationship might vary across levels of your control variable. No preliminary analyses or additional research are expected for this assignment.
