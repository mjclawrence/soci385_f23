## Comparing Samples

- Assignment questions measured the difference between an estimated mean and a null hypothesis value in terms of standard errors

- This week, we will measure the difference between two estimated means, and then measure that distance from a null hypothesis value in terms of standard errors

---

## Comparing Samples

- Basics are the same: we need means, standard errors, and null hypotheses but we estimate them slightly differently

- Assumptions are also the same
  - Distribution of differences between means is normally distributed
  - For large sample sizes, t-distribution still approximates z-distribution
  
---

## Comparing Samples

- Significance tests define groups (not datasets) as *samples*

- Samples are *independent* if the observations are random
  - Coin flips are independent of each other.
  - Across years, cross-sectional surveys (like GSS) are independent

- Samples are *dependent* if observations are matched
  - Can be the same observations in a long-term panel (PSID, NLSY, etc.) or multiple measures in a short-term study (scores from two exams)
  - Can be different observations if respondents' answers could be correlated (partners, siblings, etc.)

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- From CI for mean to CI for difference in means

- CI formula for difference in means is similar to what we used for means: $CI = (\bar{y}_2 - \bar{y}_1) \pm t(se)$

-  SE is still the first step, but now want SE *of the difference*: $se = \sqrt{ \frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$

- When coding, easier to replace numerators with variances: $se = \sqrt{ \frac{var_1}{n_1} + \frac{var_2}{n_2}}$

## CIs for Comparing Means

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

gss_week8 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjclawrence/soci385_f23/main/data/gss_week8.csv")
```

- Example using `gss_week8` data. We want to only keep observations with non-missing values for the `memnum` variable:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

gss_week8 <- gss_week8 |> 
  filter(!is.na(memnum))
```

:::

- We want to compare mean memberships across two degree categories. Options?

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- Could use binary variables or indexing. For this example, create a binary variable called `college` where everyone with at least a college degree gets a 1 and everyone else gets a 0. Try using `str_detect()` here.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

gss_week8 <- gss_week8 |> 
  mutate(college = ifelse(str_detect(degree, "Degree"), 1, 0))
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- For the standard error formula, we'll need the number of respondents in each category of `college`:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

table(gss_week8$college)
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- We also need the mean number of memberships for college degree holders and non college degree holders. Options here?

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

mean(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==0])
mean(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==1])
```

:::


---

## CIs for Comparing Means

This also works:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

gss_week8 |> 
  group_by(college) |> 
  summarise(mean_memnum = mean(memnum, na.rm = TRUE))
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- We want to know if the difference between these two means is significant

- In the language of hypothesis testing, we want to know if we can reject the null hypothesis that the true difference between these two sample means is zero

- Start with the difference:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

diff <- 2.551163 - 1.218357
diff
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- Then find the standard error of the difference: $se = \sqrt{ \frac{var_{memnum,college=0}}{n_{college=0}} + \frac{var_{memnum,college=1}}{n_{college=1}} }$

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

diffse_college0 <- var(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==0]) / 
                              1035

diffse_college1 <- var(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==1]) / 
                              430

diffse <- sqrt(diffse_college0 + diffse_college1)

diffse
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- Construct the 95% confidence interval for the difference

- Starting value is the difference, rest of the formula is the same:
  - difference $\pm$ 1.96*(standard error of difference)


::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

diff_ll95 <- diff - 1.96*diffse
diff_ul95 <- diff + 1.96*diffse
diff_ci95 <- c(diff_ll95, diff, diff_ul95)

diff_ci95
```

:::

---

## CIs for Comparing Means

- In sampling distribution, 95% of the time the difference in mean memberships between those with college degrees and those without will fall between 1.108 and 1.558

- We can be 95% confident that the difference in the population will fall within the range

- We calculated difference as `memnum[college==1] - memnum[college==0]` so positive value tells us the mean is higher for college degree holders

---

## Significance of Differences in Means

- At 95% confidence level, can we say that the mean memberships differs between these two groups? $\Large{t = \frac{observed - expected}{se}}$

- Observed = Difference; Expected = Null Hypothesis Value, Standard Error = standard error *of the observed difference*

- With means, usually $H_0: \mu = 0$ and $H_A: \mu \neq 0$

---

## Significance of Differences in Means

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Test Statistic:
((2.551163 - 1.218357) - 0) / diffse
```

:::


- Test statistic tells us observed difference is 11.62 standard errors away from null hypothesis' expected difference of 0

- 11.62 > 1.96,  so we can reject the null hypothesis

---

## Comparing Means - Shortcut!

- Place the two means you want to compare in the `t.test()` function:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

t.test(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==1], 
          gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$college==0])
```


:::


---

## Comparing Means - Shortcut

- Can reject null hypothesis
  - Test statistic more extreme than 1.96 (red box)
  - p-value less than .05 (blue box)
  - 95% confidence interval does not include null hypothesis value of zero (green box)

## Comparing Means - Exercise

- Is the difference in mean memberships between those in the "Some College" degree category and those in the "HS Diploma" degree category significant at the .01 alpha level?

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

t.test(gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$degree == "Some College"],
       gss_week8$memnum[gss_week8$degree == "HS Diploma"],
       conf.level = .99)
```

## Group Exercises

- Some of the differences we have been waiting to test!
  - Age at first birth (`agekdbrn`) by race (`racehisp`)
  - Age (`age`) by self employment status (`wrkslf`)
  - Number of political actions (`polactions`) by sex (`sex`)
  - Number of political actions (`polactions`) by class (`class`)

- Give a sociological hypothesis for why you expect the difference you are testing will or will not be statistically significant

- Test the significance of the difference in means between two categories at the 95% confidence level
