## Where We've Been

- Descriptive statistics gave us means, standard deviations
  - "What are the spreads and the shapes of our observed distributions?"

- Probability gave us ways to use our sample statistics to predict ranges of possible population parameters
  - "What is the likelihood of getting the values we observe?"

- Inference gave us tools to test significance
  - "What is the likelihood of getting a value more extreme than the values we observe?"
  - "How confident can we be that our observations differ from values of the null hypotheses?"

---

## Two Things We Still Want

1. Better conclusions
  - Asssociations peaked with correlation
  - If correlation coefficient tells us that X and Y *tend to move together*, regression tells us *how much* they tend to move together

2. Explanations of variation
  - Inference offered us ways to know if X and Y are dependent or independent (Chi-squared Test, Fisher's Test, etc.)
  - Dependent associations may be influenced by *confounding*.
  - Regression allows us to *isolate the association* of interest by controlling for other variables and/or holding them constant.

---

## Start With Regression Basics

- Basic assumption (for now): The relationship between X and Y is linear
  - HS Flashback: y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the intercept

- Linear relationship is regression equation: 
  - $\large{\hat{y_i} = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i}$
  - Read as: *regress y on x*

---

## Start With Regression Basics

- $\large{\hat{y_i} = \alpha + \beta X_i + \epsilon_i}$
  - $\hat{y_i}$ = predicted outcome, the best guess
  - $\alpha$ = intercept or constant, where the line hits the y-axis when x is 0
  - $\beta$ = the slope, the multiplier for every X, known as the coefficient
  - $X_i$ = the observed value of X
  - $\epsilon_i$ = error (or residual), difference between observed and predicted values

## Example from UN Human Development Project

### Schooling & Life Expectancy

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output-location: slide

schooling_life_plot1 <- ggplot(hdi, aes(
     x = std_schooling_expected, y = life_expectancy))
schooling_life_plot1 + geom_point(color = "Dark Gray") +
     labs(x = "Standardized Schooling Expectancy", y = "Life Expectancy",
      title = "Schooling and Life Expectancies",
      subtitle = "(UNHDP, 2021)") +
     theme(axis.title=element_text(size=18), axis.text=element_text(size=16),
      plot.title=element_text(size=18), plot.subtitle=element_text(size=16))
```

:::

---

## Fitting The Regression Line

- Recall that a *residual* is the difference between the observed value, $y$, and the predicted value on the line, $\hat{y}$

- We want a line that makes every residual as small as possible

- Every observation has a residual. How do we combine them?
  - Can't just add them up since negatives could cancel out positives
  - Absolute values are the usual fix, but they don't help as much this time since they offer little guide for where to start with $\alpha$ and $\beta$

---

## Fitting The Regression Line

- Sum of the squared residuals gets us closest
  - $SSE = \sum{(y - \hat{y})^2}$
  - Line with the smallest sum has the *least squares*: why basic regression is called *Ordinary Least Squares*

- Squaring gives extra weight to biggest residuals (the observations that a given line does a particularly bad job at including)

- To find beta and alpha, we'll use basics we have seen: how the observed x's differ from the mean of x, how the observed y's differ from the mean of y, and how the distribution of x and y tend to move together

---

## Fitting Beta and Alpha

- Let's try the example of regressing life expectancy in years on the standardized schooling expectancy

- Start with basic descriptives
  - What's the correlation between the two variables?
  - What are the mean and standard deviation of `std_schooling_expectancy`?
  - What are the mean and standard deviation of `life_expectancy`?

---

## Finding Beta and Alpha

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Correlation
cor(hdi$std_schooling_expected, hdi$life_expectancy)
```

:::

- Interpretation?

---

## Finding Beta and Alpha

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Mean and Standard Deviation of X
mean(hdi$std_schooling_expected)
sd(hdi$std_schooling_expected)
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Mean and Standard Deviation of Y
mean(hdi$life_expectancy)
sd(hdi$life_expectancy)
```

:::

---

## Fitting The Regression Line

- We have all we need to find beta: 
  - $\Large{\beta = cor_{xy} \frac {s_{y}}{s_{x}}}$

- And beta will be the missing piece to help us find alpha:
  - $\Large{\alpha = \bar{y} - \beta \bar{x}}$

---

# Finding Beta

- $\large{\beta = cor_{xy} \frac {s_{y}}{s_{x}}}$

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

beta <- cor(hdi$std_schooling_expected,
      hdi$life_expectancy) *
     (sd(hdi$life_expectancy) / 
      sd(hdi$std_schooling_expected))

beta
```

:::

---

## Interpreting Beta

- Every one unit increase in the value of X is associated with an increase of beta in the predicted value of Y, on average
  - In this model, a one standard deviation increase in schooling expectancy is associated with an increase of 6.188267 years in life expectancy, on average

- And since we are working with linear regression, a one unit decrease in the value of X is associated with a decrease of beta in the predicted value of Y, on average
  - In this model, a one standard deviation decrease in schooling expectancy is associated with a decrease of 6.188267 years in life expectancy, on average

---

## Finding Alpha

- $\large{\alpha = \bar{y} - \beta \bar{x}}$

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
alpha <- mean(hdi$life_expectancy) - 
      beta*(mean(hdi$std_schooling_expected))

alpha
```

:::

- When X is 0, our model predicts that Y should be 71.29941

- In this case (since x is standardized with a mean of 0), a country with a schooling expectancy at the average of the distribution would be predicted to have a life expectancy of 71.29941 years.

---

## Fitting The Regression Line

- Now we have our line: y = 71.29941 + 6.188267

- Let's add it to our plot using `geom_abline()`:

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output: false

schooling_life_plot1 <- ggplot(hdi, aes(
     x = std_schooling_expected, y = life_expectancy))

schooling_life_plot1 + geom_point(color = "Dark Gray") +
     labs(x = "Standardized Schooling Expectancy", 
      y = "Life Expectancy",
      title = "Schooling and Life Expectancies",
      subtitle = "(UNHDP, 2021)") +
     geom_abline(intercept = 71.29941, slope = 6.188267)
```

:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

schooling_life_plot1 + geom_point(color = "Dark Gray") +
     labs(x = "Standardized Schooling Expectancy", y = "Life Expectancy",
      title = "Schooling and Life Expectancies",
      subtitle = "(UNHDP, 2021)") +
geom_abline(intercept = 71.29941, slope = 6.188267) +
     theme(axis.title=element_text(size=18), axis.text=element_text(size=16),
      plot.title=element_text(size=18), plot.subtitle=element_text(size=16))
```

---

## Predicting Values of Y

- If the line is correct, there should be a point on the line where X = 0 and Y = 71.29941

::: {.fragment}

#| echo: true

schooling_life_plot1 + geom_point(color = "Dark Gray") +

      title = "Schooling and Life Expectancies",
      subtitle = "(UNHDP, 2021)") +
     geom_abline(intercept = 71.29941, slope = 6.188267) +
     geom_point(x = 0, y = 71.29941, color = "Red", size = 3)
```

      plot.title=element_text(size=18), plot.subtitle=element_text(size=16))
```

---

## Predicting Values of Y

- Digging Deeper: when $\large{x}$ increases by 1, $\large{\hat{y}}$ is expected to increase by 6.188267

- So if $\large{x}$ is 1 standard deviation above the mean, what is $\large{\hat{y}}$? And if $\large{x}$ is 1 standard deviation below the mean, what is $\large{\hat{y}}$?

- Prediction always has to start with value of $\large{\alpha}$!

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

predicted_y_plus1sd <- alpha + beta*1
predicted_y_plus1sd

predicted_y_minus1sd <- alpha + beta*-1

## Regression in R

- As always, R makes this easier. Meet the `lm()` command.

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Start by saving the model as an object:

schooling_life_model1 <- 
      lm(life_expectancy ~ std_schooling_expected, 
        data = hdi)
```

:::

::: {.fragment}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| output-location: fragment

# Then look at the summary of the saved model:

summary(schooling_life_model1)
```

## Regression in R

- Red Box = Alpha; Blue Box = Beta

---

# R's Regression Output - Std Error
### Std. Error = SE of the coefficient

![](385_figures/lm_model_3.png)

---

# R's Regression Output - Std Error

$\Large{se = \frac{s} {\sqrt{\sum{ (x - \bar{x})^2}}}}$

#### and

$\Large{s = \sqrt {\frac {\sum{(y - \hat{y})^2}}{n-2}}}$

---

# R's Regression Output - Std Error

### The standard error formula uses the predicted values of y to calculate the residuals

--

### R makes it easy to save all the predicted values from a model:

--

```{r}
hdi$predicted_life_expectancy <- 
    schooling_life_model1$fitted.values
```

---

# R's Regression Output - Std Error

### Now you can plug in the predicted values to the rest of the standard error equation:

--

```{r}
se_numerator <- sqrt(sum((hdi$life_expectancy - 
  hdi$predicted_life_expectancy)^2) / 
    (length(hdi$life_expectancy) - 2))

se_denominator <- sqrt(sum((hdi$std_schooling_expected - 
  mean(hdi$std_schooling_expected))^2))

se <- se_numerator / se_denominator

se
```

---

# R's Regression Output - Std Error

![](385_figures/lm_model_3.png)

---

# R's Regression Output - T Value

### t = test statistic for a t-test that coefficient differs from zero


![:scale 90%](385_figures/lm_model_4.png)

---

# R's Regression Output - T Value

### t = coefficient estimate / standard error

--

```{r}
6.1883 / .3579
```

---

# R's Regression Output - T Value

![:scale 90%](385_figures/lm_model_4.png)

---

# R's Regression Output - P Value

### P>|t| = p-value for two-tailed test


![](385_figures/lm_model_5.png)

---

# R's Regression Output - P Value

```{r}
# Area in right tail:
pr_tail <- 1 - pt(17.29, df = 168)

# Area in both tails (what output gives):
2 * pr_tail
```

--

### Can we reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient for `std_schooling_expectancy` is different from 0?

--

### Yes, because `Pr(>|t|)` is less than .05

--

### Note the stars!

# Plotting Regressions

### More common to use `geom_smooth(method = lm)` than `geom_abline()`:

--

```{r, eval = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 8}
schooling_life_plot1 + geom_point(color = "Dark Gray") +
     labs(x = "Standardized Schooling Expectancy",

      title = "Schooling and Life Expectancies",
