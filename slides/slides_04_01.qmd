## Measures of Association

- Last week: describing two categorical variables

- This week: describing relationship between two numerical variables

- Remember a hypothesis: How variables *tend to move together*
  - How close or tight are the values? How well do they resemble a straight line?
  - The spread that they tend to share = covariance
  - The change they tend to share = correlation
  
---

## Interpreting Correlations

- Easier to interpret correlations than covariances

- Always bounded by -1, 1

- Association is linear (for now)

- Positive correlation > 0
  - When X is larger than its mean, likely that Y is larger than its mean

- Negative correlation < 0
  - When X is larger than its mean, unlikely that Y is larger than its mean
  
---

## Interpreting Correlations

- Correlation of X, Y = Correlation of Y, X
  - But still think of axes
  
- Not affected by changes in scale
  - Can multiply all the values by a constant and the correlation is still the same
  - Temperature degrees, currencies, etc. 
  
- But can be affected by outliers

---

## Strength of Association

- Positive correlation coefficients look like proportions but they are not

- Strong association: knowing a value of one variable helps predict a value of the other variable

- Weak association: too much variability to use the value of one variable to make a good guess about the value of the other variable 

- Remember: Not causal!

- Keep in mind: *strong* is not always *better*

---

## Strength of Associations

- No association = 0 to .19 or 0 to -.19

- Weak association = .20 to .29 or -.20 to -.29

- Moderate association = .30 to .49 or -.30 to -.49

- Strong association = .50 to .69 or -.50 to -.69

- Very strong association = greater than .70 or less than -.70

## An Example: Chetty et al (2014)

- Comparing income mobility rates across regions

- Regional variation across 741 "Commuting Zones"
  - Cover all counties (not just metropolitan statistical areas)
  - We are in the Burlington, VT commuting zone

- Tax data from parents of 6.3 million children born in 1980-2
  - Identify CS and parent's income when child was age 16
  - Compare to child's income around age 30
  
- Main measure of upward mobility = the average income rank in the children's income distribution for children growing up at the 20th percentile in the parent's income distribution
