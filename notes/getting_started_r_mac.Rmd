## SOCI 385 - Fall 2023
## Software Setup (Mac Version)

**1) Download and Install `R`**

`R` is available as a free download at [`this site`](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/). If your Mac has a silicon M1 chip (possible if you purchased your computer within the last couple years), download the `R-4.3.1-arm64.pkg` version. If you have an Intel-based Mac, you should download the `R-4.3.1.pkg` version. 

After choosing the version of `R` you want, click to install and follow the on-screen instructions. To test if the installation was successful, open `R`, type `summary(cars)` in the console (where the blinking cursor is) and press enter. You should see the summary of the `speed` and `dist` variables from the built-in `cars` dataset.

**2) Install `tinytex`**

`R` uses LaTeX to produce pdf documents from `Quarto` files. To install the parts of LaTeX that we will need, type the following into the `R` console and then press enter:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages('tinytex')
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

The package will download to your library and may also install additional necessary packages. The console arrow will reappear when the installations are complete.

**3) Download and Install `R Studio`**

`R Studio` is available as a free download at [`this site`](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Scroll down to find the installer for the free RStudio Desktop version. Click the download button. When the download is complete, double click on the installer. You may have to drag the `R Studio` icon to the `Applications` folder to start the installation process. Then follow any on-screen instructions.

To test if the installation was successful, open `R Studio` - not `R` - and type `summary(cars)` on the command line in the `Console` quadrant (the bottom left panel). When you press enter you should see the same summary of the `speed` and `dist` variables from the built-in `cars` dataset.

**4) Test `R Markdown`**

You can test if `tinytex` was installed correctly by opening `R Studio` again. Click the `File` menu bar, scroll down to `New File`, and select `Quarto Document`. If a message appears suggesting you install additional packages, do so. Enter "Setting Up R" in the Title field, your name in the `Author` field, select "HTML" as the output format, and then click `Create`. A default template should open in the top left panel of `R Studio`.

Now let's see if everything is working properly. Save this file in a folder where you want to save your work for this class. Then click the `Render` button on the toolbar just above where the title of your document has been inserted. If everything installed correctly and is working well, you should have just created an HTML document in your working directory.
